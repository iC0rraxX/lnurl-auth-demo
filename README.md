# A LNURL-auth Demo

This is a simple demo site to showcase how damn cool it is to log in with Lightning. âš¡

The main purpose is to spread awareness and let people know that this exists and not only works, but works really well already. This whole project was inspired by [stacker.news](https://stacker.news/), so shout-out to [@huumn](https://github.com/huumn). Also shout-out to [@fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf) for his work on LNURL and for curating the [awesome-lnurl](https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl) list.

### Live Demo

Try out the site on [LightningLogin.Live](https://lightninglogin.live/)

### Buttons

Button assets are to be found in the [lightning-buttons](https://github.com/seetee-io/lightning-buttons) repository.
