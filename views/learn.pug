        | The #[i Login with Lightning] button is powered by LNURL-auth, a
        | lightweight authentication protocol that is easy to use, easy to
        | implement, and #[em respects the user's privacy].

  +section('What is LNURL-auth?', true)
    p
      a(href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-auth.md") LNURL-auth
      |
      | is a generic authentication protocol. It authenticates the
      | user using digital signatures, which means that the user needs to have a
      | public-private key pair. Thanks to the rising popularity of
      |
      a(href="https://bitcoiner.guide/wallet/lightning/") lightning wallets
      | , more and more users are in possession of and have easy access
      | to such keys.
    p
      | Consequently, users are identified by their public keys,
      | nothing else. The protocol does not require any other identifying
      | information such as passwords, emails, usernames, or similar.

  +section('How does it work?')
    p
      | In short: the seed of your bitcoin wallet is used to generate secret
      | authentication keys. As soon as you want to log in to a website, the
      | website will pose a specific challenge that you can only solve with
      | your secret authentication key.

      | A more technical explanation can be found&nbsp;
      a(href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/04.md") here
      | .

  +section('Are identities persistent?')
    p
      | Yes, but it does not transfer across sites or wallets.
    p
      | Because a different authentication key is generated for every domain,
      | you will be identified by a different public key for every site. Your
      | identities can not be associated across domains.
    p
      | However, as long as you log in to a site with the same wallet, you will
      | have the same identity.

  +section('Who uses it?')
    p
      | A list of services that make use of LNURL-auth is maintained&nbsp;
      a(href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/README.md#services") here
